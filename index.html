		<h1> The Beaver </h1>
		<h3> (an awesome animal) </h3> 
		<p> 	I like beavers. They build dams and lodges, these buildings are normally made out sticks and mud. The dams help create ponds so they can have space to build lodges. The lodges are like homes for the beavers. Each of these homes have two rooms, one for drying off after coming through the secert underwater entrance, and the other for chilling, playing, and eating. Some pf the things that they eat are shrubs and wood. They eat wood to wear down their teeth so they don't get too long because their teeth are always growing. Also beavers are very social animals. They live with many other beavers. </p>
