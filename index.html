		<h1> The Beaver </h1>
		<h3> (an awesome animal) </h3> 
		<p> I like beavers. They build dams and lodges, these buildings are normally made out sticks and mud. The dams help create ponds so they can have space to build lodges. The lodges are like homes for the beavers. Each of these homes have two rooms, one for drying off after coming through the secert underwater entrance, and the other for chilling, playing, and eating.</p>
