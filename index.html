		<h1> The Beaver </h1>
		<h3> (an awesome animal) </h3>
		<h4> by Alex Gervais </h4>

		<h2>THE FACTS!</h2>
		<p>Beavers are pretty cool animals.</p>  
		<p>They build dams and lodges, these buildings are normally made out sticks and mud.</p>
		<p>They use their big tails to slap mud onto their dams and or lodges.</p> 
		<p>The dams help create ponds so they can have space to build lodges.</p>
		<p>The lodges are like homes for the beavers. Each of these homes have two rooms, one for drying off after coming through the secert underwater entrance, and the other for chilling, playing, and eating.</p> 
		<p>Some of the things that they eat are shrubs and wood.</p> 
		<p> They eat wood to wear down their teeth so they don't get too long because their teeth are always growing.</p> 
		<p> Also beavers are very social animals. They live with many other beavers in lodges.</p>
		<p> Beavers are sometimes mistaken for otters, but there are many differences bettwen them.</p> 
		<p>First off, Beavers make dams and otters don't.</p>
		<p>Also otters live in the ocean not rivers like beavers.</p>
		<p>One more thing is that beavers don't hug each other but otters are renowned for that.</p>
		<p> So overall beavers are very cool animals and are awesome! üêª </p>

		<p> One time I was walking around in the woods and I encountered a big building made of a strange red material, I went through these doors and saw a big staircase. I looked and saw a long hallway, with a strange creature looking down on me. It looked sort off like the monsters of old who hunted our ancestors and killed them. He tralked in a strange dialect that I could barley undersatnd, he said "Hi little guy! You look lost! You can come and learn HTML and CSS with me at Larry's Web Development class." So we walked down this hall and then took a right than another right into a huge room. We went in and this guy told me to sit on a chair and he gave me thsi mystical device, it had ancient human letters on it and I started to let my hands fly and I coded a website! That is how I coded a website!</p>
